        <h3>From the Bayou...</h3>

            <p>South Louisiana has a lot of tradition mixed into it's culture, from food and Mardi Gras to family relationships. I grew up living on the land. We grew alot of our own fruits and vegetables but also hunted and raised alot of animals. Fishing and hunting were at the top of that list. At a young age I was taught how to catch snakes and aligators but that a green thumb was important. Growing okra to put in a gumbo or watermelon to eat on the really humid days. Everything was done in a family environment. The people that helped you clean a deer were normally cousins and the people that helped you cook were normally grandparents. Most evening were spent on the porch talking about the day and what was to come.</p>

        <h3>...To the Desert...</h3>

            <p>During high school I noticed that I was not being challenged to my full potential. Along came a Marine Corps recruiter. I enlisted in 2006 and became a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear Defense specialist. My primary job was to teach teams of Marines and Sailors to defend themselves in hazordous environments, namely chemical and biological. During my tenure I trained over 15,000 Marines along with 4 teams that went on to train other countries. In 2008, I had the previlege to serve overseas. I deployed to Iraq as a driver for a Secuirity Company. Our primary objective was route reconnaissance, VIP escort and convoy security. After 8 months overseas and a total of 4 years of active service, I decided that the home was where I wanted to be.</p>

        <h3>...Back to My Roots</h3>

           <p>After years of being away and traveling all over the world, I decided that family was more important. I came back home and started working in the oil field. It was there that my skills truly started to shine. I strove to work hard which made others follow me in a "Lead by Example" type of leadership style. Logistics became my niche. I was able to keep track of multiple projects and manage others time to meet my companies goals. It was never just about the company though. Using skills I learned growing up and those skills that were later honed in the military prepared me to excel in life.</p>
